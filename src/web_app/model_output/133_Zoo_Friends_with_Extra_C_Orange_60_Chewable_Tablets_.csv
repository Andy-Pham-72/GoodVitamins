I was surprised that both complete contain copper but after reading I realized that copper plays an important role in maintaining a normal blood composition helps to avoid anaemia and promotes better absorption of iron. And also copper is involved in creating a sheath of nerve fibres. Of course the famous Animal Parade has a richer composition but it also costs much more. In addition the basic elements that are in the composition of Too Friends are enough for us for now. The vitamin taste quite pleasant they dissolve for a long time. The child likes it. The figures are very cut. The taste is in principle standard not very sweet. It smells like yoghurt from the jar but the taste is not quite the same a little sources a little sweetness a little vitamin base - standard for children's vitamin. Over with protection screws only after pressing.,3

Supplement in the form of animals. Children love its natural taste and this is very important. Vitamin in a cheadle form it is convenient since many children cannot swallow tablets and capsules. There are several vital vitamin to provide your child with the best supplement to complement their healthy diet. Vitamin D is limited in food.
