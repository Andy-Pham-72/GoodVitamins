I bought a child 2.8 years old. Is a first acquaintance with vitamin it will do. The composition is not overloaded vitamin C D E and opera - 369. Meg from vegetable raw materials - china seed oil DHA is also vegetable - all oil  There is no fish in the composition. The marmalade is fragrant the slices themselves are soft and small to taste - sweet and sour very easy to chew I tried a couple of them myself. The jar is enough for a month of taking for our age. I did not cause galleries during the intake. In addition the child was not given anything from supplement. Sinus a star for a large amount of sugar in the composition. And so - quite pleasant fortified marmalade.,4

Any child will love to eat sweet summits. His is a safe bet when in doubt whether your child will drink the liquid version of Meg 3 which often tastes unpleasant to children. By child loves them very much and always asks for a supplement. There are not so many Meg 3 but for that vitamin D E C which are no less useful for the child's immunity are added in the correct forms. The jar will last for a month and the price is quite reasonable. Plus I have a lot of loyalty to the Member baby food brand. To I think this supplement is very successful.,5

The problem of opera-3 is not excited from the body and does not exist except in certain types of fish and there are no alternatives to it except with supplement. It is best when buying a supplement to make sure that it is free from opera-6 because it prevents the absorption of opera-3. Is for opera-6 is available in many foods the presence of opera 6 deprives you of the benefits of opera 3,1
