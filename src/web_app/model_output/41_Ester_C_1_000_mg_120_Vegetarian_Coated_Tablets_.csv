I think this drug is one of the best which contains vitamin C in an effective formula that is absorbed evenly throughout the day and without stress on the kidneys and harmful effects on the gastric mucous. I recommend that you pay attention to this effective preparation containing vitamin C in the effective formula of Esther C. Considering that the number of tablets in a package is 120 this application is beneficial and one package lasts for a very long time. After regular use Vitamin C Nature's County After-C 24 hour immune support noticeably strengthens the gums bleeding disappears during brushing even with a hard toothbrush. Also capillary network on the skin gradually disappear since in addition to vitamin C in a therapeutic dose this preparation contains cities bioflavonoids rich in natural ruin which has a beneficial effect on blood vessels and capillaries.,5
Spoiled for opponents longridov Everyone since childhood knows why we need vitamin C. It least to maintain immunity. With a cold drink 3000mg.  In.  His is Vitamin After Formula - organic multi-component. It is absorbed by the body gradually and better than synthesis vitamin C which is very quickly excited in the urine. But still it is better to take it rationally so 1 tax. divide by 4-6 doses per day max. 3-4 hours is preserved in the blood. The capsules are soft they are easy to bite off not bitter - almost tactless. Vitamin water-double drink a large amount of water.  Either scientists nor doctors can determine the dose of vitamin C. The doctor endocrinologist for whom I have been observing recommends a minimum of 1000 my  day. Of you have a lot of stress then drink 2000mg 2 tax.  May. 1000mg will only go to the formation of cortical which is produced under stress. And it is necessary that remains still on - Help immunity; - ensuring the strength of bones; - assistance in the take of glucose by cells so as not to eat sweets in kilograms; - maintenance of college fibres; - transport of oxygen through the body; - the formation of thyreoid mormons; - the formation of serotonin - the harmony of joy;  Today the content of vitamin C in the products we buy in stores has decreased. The daily dose of the vitamin is contained in ~ 4 g of oranges or ~ 16 g. lemons. That is you just need to enter in the diet of vitamin C in the form of dietary supplement. Especially if you notice that your gums are bleeding or varicose veins. Or you are often drawn to the sweet. Vitamin C also helps to lose weight because it stimulated the production of an enzyme that horseradish you utter but it controls the deposition of fat cells.  In general an infinitely useful and important vitamin for our body. The list of its usefulness is endless. Since independently it is not synthesized in our body it can be drunk without interruption. The body will take the necessary and the excess will lead.  Ascorbic acid and organic vitamin C are different things and the dosage is different.  Useful facts - Ascorbic acid is a monoproduct synthesis laboratory. - Organic vitamin C will be called After-si L-ascorbate L-ascorbic acid dehydroascorbate. - Often our desire to eat or eat sweets is the body's desire to replenished the vitamin C content in the blood. - Serotonin is synthesized in melanin - a sleep harmony. That is vitamin C is also a remedy for insomnia. - It has anticarcinogenic antiviral and antimicrobial effects.,5
Before buying this After-C read the supplement facts indicated on the product.,5
HOW NOT of of SICK. I am sharing the experience that my family and I have been using for 7 years. It the first sign of a cold it doesn't matter ARVI or fly we immediately drink 3 g of vitamin C of course less for children that is three tablets and drink plenty of water after an hour you can repeat -3 g plus water. When every hour 2 g  until the symptoms disappear a total of about 10 g per day or less comes out. To not be afraid of overcome this is not ascorbic acid and does not have its toxicity. They hoped this way even with the fly by the way the temperature goes away from vitamin C perfectly in a day it is important not to forget about water and start drinking at the very first symptoms. In an empty stomach it is much more effective than after eating. In general if you drink vitamin C 1500 my per day rationally then the likelihood of catching a cold is very small. The tablets are large enough there may be problems for those who have difficulty swallowing but it is quite easy to gnaws the taste is slightly sour.

The metabolites in After-C help better retain vitamin C in white blood cells which are a vital component of the immune system. To when you take your daily dose of After-C it goes into your white blood cells and stays there for at least 24 hours which is longer than standard vitamin C. † In addition After-C is produced without the use of chemicals to neutralise levels pp therefore the drug does not increase the aridity in the stomach and acts mildly.
