The diet of my and my family is not enough for vitamin C especially in the autumn-winter season. Therefore we all take vitamin C. I and my family have tried many supplement with vitamin C offered by herb. It home I prefer sodium ascorbate and in powder since I myself can regulate the dose that I need at the moment and it is very different depending on the state of the body and external conditions. In addition this sodium ascorbate is absolutely not pacific it does not irritate my sensitive stomach it does not contain so.  Vitamin C deficiency leads to impaired immunity and increased susceptibility to infections. Vitamin C promotes immune defense supporting various functions of both congenital and captive immunity. Leucocytes such as neutrophile and monocytes actively accumulate vitamin C in concentration 50-100 times higher than plasma concentration. Vitamin C is capable of enhancing chemotaxis migration of neutrophile to the site of infection phagocytosis neutrophile absorption by pathogenic generation of oxidants and destruction of microbes proptosis in the control of pathogenic. Also supports the function of the epithelial barrier normalized the production of cytokines. In turn infections significantly affect the levels of vitamin C because of increased inflammation and metallic needs. In studies it has been shown that in infections the level of vitamin C in leucocytes decreases and for its stabilization neither 90 the recommended norm nor 200 my  day is enough gram doses are required. Therefore at the first sign of a vital infection we take 2-4 g of vitamin C per day. And it helps to do without illness.  Cardiovascular health is impossible without an adequate level of vitamin C. Vitamin C deficiency leads to inability dysfunction of the walls of blood vessels and further to atherosclerosis heart attacks and strokes. A widely known vitamin C researcher for cardiovascular health recommends a daily intake of 600-3000 my.  Vitamin C is one of the safest substances. Studies have confirmed that even the long-term use of vitamin C in large doses does not cause the formation of palate stones in people with normal renal function. The situation is different for people with a reduced rate of glomerular infiltration. In people with diagnosed kidney stone disease there is an increased isolation of palate in the urine which increases after the administration of even minimal doses of ascorbic acid. Usually they sit on a strict diet. Such persons are not recommended to take vitamin C.  Fig request to vote for a tip and a photo. Thank you in advance,5

Vitamin C perform the following functions in our body which in my opinion are very important it increases defense helps to cope with acute respiratory vital infections and influenza maintains the health of blood vessels reduces the risk of cardiovascular diseases participates in college synthesis and accelerated the process of removing toxins from the body. Vitamin C here is in the form of ascorbate which is obtained by dissolving ascorbic acid in sodium bicarbonate obtained from the earth. The advantage of sodium ascorbate is that it is well absorbed by the body and also has a neutral pp. Even when taking large doses of the drug 2-3 g per day it will not cause stomach pain.

Not the first time I order and not the last for sure The best vitamin and the best form will not harm you but only increase your health. Vitamin C is a water-double vitamin and therefore needs to be replenished every day. The most assimilable form of the vitamin as in the intestine transport channels for absorption at the cellular level are sodium-based. It is this form that does not load the kidneys but is not suitable for megadoses protocol. IMPORTANT - keep the packing closed - quickly stooped up with a spoon material - plastic wooden chromic - avoid metal oxidation and closed it right there. He dissolve the water with the vitamin and drink it immediately - it breaks down quickly.,5
It's good that the vitamin is presented here in powder you can dose the intake yourself. Indeed one of the important methods of taking vitamin C is that it must be taken in portions little by little a day. A well-known endocrinologist advised crushing the pill and taking it in parts because vitamin C is absorbed gradually and when you drink the whole pill as a whole taking the right amount the body extremes almost all of it through urine staining it in a rich color. His form avoids this. Plus sodium aids in absorption,5
