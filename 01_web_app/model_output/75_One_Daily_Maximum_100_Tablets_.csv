Good vitamin for the price. I don't think you should expect much from them. Sometimes it is possible for prevention.,4
I bought these vitamin because I liked the composition there are all vitamin in a good ratio of the daily requirement and some important micro-macroelements. But after studying many different articles opinions of different nutritionists having studied the reviews of my friends and my personal observations I came to the conclusion that such expensive vitamin and mineral complete are useless and also harmful to the body.  Why did I come to this conclusion  In average a good quality vitamin-mineral complex that really works costs 4 times more than cheaper counterpart like this one. His is due to the quality or rather to the forms of vitamin and minerals that are added to the complex.  All vitamin and minerals have different forms of production in terms of quality the level of assimilation and safety for humans. For example a simple form of mineral production is called Nitrate and the effectiveness of this form is also simple but there are more effective forms of minerals Relate Glycinate Picolinate. These forms of minerals come in a protein shell for maximum absorption. Not everyone knows that without protein not a single mineral can be transported into the blood to enrich the body. These forms of protein-coated minerals are more expensive to manufacture and take up more capsule space.  The same goes for vitamin. For example one B vitamin has different names and the simplest forms of these vitamin can be produced almost from ordinary chalk.  Everyone is used to the fact that Vitamin C is ascorbic acid in fact vitamin C has more powerful and effective forms for example Calcium Ascorbate After-C Sodium Ascorbate Ascorbyl Palmitate. And regular ascorbic acid is just the cheapest form of vitamin C which is bad for the stomach if taken too much.  The famous calcium is added everywhere in the form of calcium carbonate this is the cheapest form of calcium and it is produced from ordinary flooring I have flooring flowing from my tap all year round collect and sell the costs are zero. Calcium carbonate is not absorbed by the body at all and even worse such cheap calcium will clot the kidneys and can lead to kidney stones. There is really useful calcium it costs several times more - Calcium Palate or Related calcium. The same goes for Magnesium.  By opinion is that it is better to buy good quality vitamin separately and take courses divide the intake for a year. For example take B vitamin separately from all other vitamin and minerals together with opera 3 fish oil since B vitamin and fish oil effectively regulate cholestrol levels lowering bad cholestrol. Vitamin D should be taken with a good form of calcium and magnesium to help strengthen bones. Vitamin A C and E taken together with zinc and selenium will have a powerful antioxidant effect to support the whole body especially to support vision. A very important element is Iodine I recommend taking natural natural iodine in the form of an extract from seated - Laminaria Help and not in the form of synthesis iodine which can be harmful He healthy,1
I began to observe intermittent fasting do light exercise and take various multivitamin complete. The result - I feel great - a lot of energy eyes shine and hair shine Excellent,5
The composition is the cheapest not very good in quality but what could be expected for such a price. The forms of oxide only help with constipation and so ... from the useful Of nicotine in a not very large dosage and a couple of vitamin,3

Before that I took Entry 130 pus. They are very similar in composition but they come out more profitable in price,4
Budget vitamin and minerals to support health.,4
Dietary supplement from must Century are definitely better than pharmacy ones  Despite such a mediocre composition these vitamin are an excellent alternative to pharmacy vitamin only cheaper. A big plus of the must century in front of most pharmacy vitamin and mineral complete is the indication of complete information about the composition the forms of vitamin and minerals their% ratio of the daily requirement while our pharmacy complete do not contain such information. I believe that the must Century brand a worker has never let down a budget segment but this does not bother me it is important that there is a result of 100%,5

a complex vitamin in the winter is necessary before that the brother in a green jar - I liked it because it is not there I will try this,5
The tablets are large enough almost all vitamin are larger it's good that I don't have problems swallowing large tablets. The color of the tablets is bright red but the surface is smooth so there should be no problems with swallowing. There is practically no smell they ate a perceptible smell of medicines but it is so insignificant that it is almost impossible to feel it. I take vitamin 2 times a year for a month in the off-season when I get minimal amounts of vitamin with food and also during cold I believe that the body fights cold faster and without complications. I am satisfied with the result I feel great even in the morning I get up vigorous I don’t observe changes in the skin hair and nails for the worse therefore I can judge that the vitamin are not even bad. There are many different vitamin in the company's line I will test others and share my opinion.,5

I have been buying these vitamin for more than three years. Our diet does not provide us with the necessary vitamin and minerals and these vitamin have everything we need. Conveniently one tablet. His option is suitable for those who often forget to take vitamin on time according to the scheme and who find it easier to take one tablet a day and not remember about it again. Of course taking vitamin according to the scheme separately is more effective but it is better to take this one pill once where all the vitamin are mixed than not to do it at all just because you do not have the opportunity to organize the intake of separate elements according to the schedule. In any case your body will be grateful to you. The effect of taking it comes around the second week - you will feel a surge of vitality. 4 stars for the size and shell of the vitamin. By stomach doesn't take these vitamin very well if I'm hungry. Therefore I am twitching to gelatin-coated capsules. His is my personal reaction as my husband will continue to accept this option. He does not have the same sensations as I do. I advise you to take it not on an empty stomach but with food and not in the morning but closer to 12 noon with an afternoon snack or lunch.,4

Multivitamins and Minerals must Century One Daily Maximum is a complex of multivitamins and minerals with maximum action it contains 30 important ingredient to support the full sanctioning of the body. Now let's look at the pro and sons of this drug. PROS 1 the presence of vitamin K since its lack less than 25% of the daily value negative affects heart health; 2 high iron content which is very important with low haemoglobin; 3 iodine zinc and copper are enough magnesium is not enough but for such a price it is a sin to complain; 4 400 units of vitamin D which is not much but better than nothing; 5 it is important that there are no carcinogenic preservatives BHA and BHT which are banner in many countries in some other preparations of this brand these preservatives are present; 6 low cost and broad balanced composition. Now let's talk about the MINUSES 1 all the components of this complex are not in a created form which is best absorbed by the body; 2 magnesium oxide is absorbed worse than all other forms of magnesium; 3 it's bad that there is no luetin in the composition which supports eye health. To how best to take these vitamin Karl Wendell in The Vitamin and Mineral Handbook writes that vitamin and minerals are better absorbed when taken with food. I follow this method. To not forget that fat is needed to assimilate fat-double vitamin A E D K. Humming up all of the above I can recommend taking the multivitamin complex One Daily Maximum in case of hypovitaminosis  avitaminosis; with a lack of micro-microelements in the body; with increased physical mental visual stress; during the recovery period after injuries infectious diseases; with inadequate balanced nutrition; with a breakdown; with distraction of attention; with memory impairment; with weakened immunity; with hormonal disruption.
