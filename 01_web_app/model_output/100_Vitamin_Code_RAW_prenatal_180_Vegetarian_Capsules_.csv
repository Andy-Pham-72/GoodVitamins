By favorite company. I love almost everything that they do and honestly admit I thought that I would only take them all the pregnancy. But it did not work out. Large solid glass jar the contents in the form of capsules. The volume of 90 and 180 pieces. You need to take 1 capsule 3 times a day preferably with a meal but you can also on an empty stomach. The composition is great These are whole-food vitamin here we have a complete list of vitamin and minerals extracts of various fruits vegetables and feelings. Six to improve digestion which includes lactobacilli. The song not the composition The only negative is not enough calcium and magnesium so keep that in mind. I took them all the second trimester it took 1.5 banks and part of the third. To side effects everything went great. Her hair is sticking up her nails are strong her teeth are not crumbling there is plenty of energy her head is working everything is fine with the baby. To questions. Excellent working formula I can advise from the bottom of my heart Why all the same did not stop them Were two things for me personally - the inconvenience of admission and the price of the issue. It first I was terribly annoyed to take them as much as three times a day. I completely forgot about them because I flew off to work in the morning returned late at night. I hardly taught myself to drink 2 capsules in the morning and one in the evening. All the same taking once a day is the most. And of course the price-economy. It took one and a half banks for a trimester and consequently the cost of the course has increased significantly. But if such problems are not worth taking for you Vitamin are truly excellent Of the review was helpful to you please click YES,4
Vitamin CODE from Garden of life ordered for the first time. I received the order about a month ago but I only opened the vitamin yesterday so I can’t say anything about their beneficial effects on the body. But since they are one of the most expensive - in the category “For nursing mothers” I decided to count the number of capsules in a jar. And alas disappointed. Instead of 180 capsules declared on the package I counted only 170. It is not good to deceive people have a conscience,1
Saw them at the planning stage. It was always possible to bring all indicator back to normal although for some I had specific questions initially. The process went well twice 2 kiss. I think that this complex has played an important role so I think that this is a very good complex for those planning.,5
An herb please response to why I would have two differently labelled VITAMIN CODE One the left is  purchased early March 2020 One the right is  purchased early An 2020 I was frightened when I noticed the differences And not just that same brand same category same doing but different nutrition serving as labelled behind. The units used were different and worse some nutrition at are different too. Right bottle vs Left bottle It C  60mg vs 120mg VIT E  30IU of 19MG VIT K  50MG of 90MCG IRON  18MG of 27MG ZINC  7.5MG of 13MG I am confused and very concern of what I am consuming. Please response to update me if there is anything that matters.,1
A complete and necessary complex of vitamin. The composition is pure without any chemical elements. The main thing is suitable for vegetarian.,5
I ordered a rd jar of vitamin and found that the label changed a little and the composition changed the dosage of individual vitamin somewhere decreased somewhere they increased. Also calcium and magnesium disappeared from the composition. I admit I was a little practice didn’t the face come to me I decided to write a question to the support service on the official Garden of Life webster the answer came - yes indeed the composition has changed a bit in particular due to the fact that the FDA changed the daily allowance for vitamin and in general the company periodically improves the formula. To if someone was worried too do not worry His is not face ,5
I am already drinking 6 can I started ordering when 2.5 months after giving birth my hair started to fall out. Loss completely stopped after 1 month. When after six months I decided to take a break I decided to save money and bought other vitamin too with herb. And again the paws ache the tail falls off the wool limbs. I will never change them again while I continue to use these vitamin the best that I can take. In allergic child did not give any reaction,5
have been searching high and low and found this brand of multivitamin for myself as i am pregnant and that is not putting much june inside. It contains Vitamin B9folate instead of Colic and Vitamin B12 methylcobalamin instead of Cyanocobalamin. It is Saw whole food multivitamin. It has also no hinders or tillers. It contain these minerals include calcium iodine iron magnesium selenium and zinc.The full list of macrominerals and microminerals looks more like this; born calcium copper chromic iodine iron manganese magnesium molybdenum phosphorus potassium selenium silicon strontium vanadium and zinc. It is considered a very decent multivitamin from herb. However the best source for minerals that our body can use naturally are cultured using least i.e. Saccharomyces cerevisiae or are created using the relation method invented and patentee by Lion Minerals. I would give it a star for this multivitamin,4
