Dietary supplement from must Century are definitely better than pharmacy ones  Despite such a mediocre composition these vitamin are an excellent alternative to pharmacy vitamin only cheaper. A big plus of the must century in front of most pharmacy vitamin and mineral complete is the indication of complete information about the composition the forms of vitamin and minerals their% ratio of the daily requirement while our pharmacy complete do not contain such information. I believe that the must Century brand a worker has never let down a budget segment but this does not bother me it is important that there is a result of 100%,5

I must say right away that the complex is not the most ideal since colic acid is not in the best inaccessible form late instead of methylfolate methylfolate is better absorbed and B12 is not in the best form methylmethylcobalamin is needed not cyanocobalamin. However all other B vitamin are presented in the best form bioavailable to the body. The volume of the jar is 60 tablets take 1 per day. Thus the jar is enough for a full course. It is necessary to do a course of vitamin of group B twice a year. That I noticed after taking this complex - Hair and nails began to grow better - Sleep and mood improved. The began to fall asleep without sleeping pills. I recommend to use I shoot a star for the form of vitamin B12 and late. Of my review was useful please rate it.,4
