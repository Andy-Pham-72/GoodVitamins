Of you are sick and have not previously taken q 3 it is recommended to take 30000 of for the first 3-5 days then reduce the dose to 5000-10000. The shape of the drops makes it easy to dose the vitamin. Now it is called the pro-harmony. Because without it our hormonal system will not work properly. By constant purchase. Before him I took d 3 in capsules at a dosage of 10000 of and in 10 months gained only 57. The liquid sublingual form allows you to replenished the vitamin much faster since with this intake D 3 enters the bloodstream directly passing the gastrointestinal tract. Considering that at the present time healthy non-inflamed intestines cannot be found with fire during the day I think the sublingual form is optical for taking.
