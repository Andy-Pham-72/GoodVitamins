Only the lazy is not talking about vitamin D now. May one thing but you need to act. I'll tell you about my example in December 2016 my vitamin D level was only 6 no  my that is catastrophically low. The labors of Or. AMEN prompted me to pass this analysis. But despite the available knowledge I reacted rather coolly to the solution of this issue. I bought capsules from the manufacturer Collar 600 units and took them on an irregular basis. There were no changes. And they shouldn't have happened That was the clinic for many years 5 and more I have noted apathy low mood lack of strength and desire to do something. There were serious problems with stool and there were always glances with a few extra pounds of body weight. After a chance acquaintance with a doctor who is fond of anti-raging medicine she plunged into this topic thoroughly. I carefully studied this issue and began to choose a drug. I chose this one. There are three reasons 1. A combination of vitamin D and K taking vitamin D is necessary only in combination with vitamin K. 2. Good dosage of vitamin D and K. 3. There is iodine in the composition which is very important. Accepted dosage 1. Within two weeks 2 capsules per day 10000 units strictly with meals  in parallel with Meg-3. 2. Over the next two weeks 1 capsule on the first day 2 capsules on the second day. A month later I took tests to see how vitamin D is absorbed. The analysis showed a level of 40 no  my which was very pleasing as it received a positive trend. Is of my mood improves I restore an active sports regiment 5-6 sessions per week including training in the pool I get up much easier in the morning I feel much better. By recommendation I consider it right to control the level of vitamin D and take it on an going basis. For dosage contact a competent specialist. The principle of therapy by the world's leading experts in anti-raging therapy is to first give loading doses followed by a gradual decrease until good numbers are achieved in control tests and then - on an going basis take 3500 units daily. I also recommend reading the article by Or. Dark Man on the econettochkaru webster where he simply explains to ordinary people the importance of maintaining high levels of vitamin D in the blood preferably 80-100 Take care of yourself and be happy All awareness and long life.,5
I give the child on a daily basis in the morning for breakfast But D and K it is very important to drink to K all and at least 2 times a year and iodine Great combination of vital elements Of not difficult put YES,5
After the birth of two children the baby was in a catastrophe state. Engaged them closely. I took 3 months of vitamin D this for 2 capsules in the morning 10000 of opera multivitamins spirulina and lecithin. Such a set I can recommend to everyone without exception inch. children According to the results I passed the tests vitamin D 108 do not worry the ELISA method in most laboratories greatly overestimated the figures so even up to 170 even the norm I am going to drink another 10000 dosage a week then I will switch to 5000 and I will drink 5000 every summer. Children also raised vitamin D switched to prophylactic dosage. I feel everything is fine too in the morning cheerfulness more strength for physical activity better mood. The thyreoid gland also returned to normal and the cycle became regular. In the body everything is connected deficiencies lead to breakdown in biochemical processes. Therefore the basis of health proper nutrition good sleep physical activity in the fresh air and the elimination of all deficiencies Of anything I'm a biochemist so I have an idea. All health I really liked the addition of this one in terms of price  quality  composition I took both myself and children and I advise everyone.,5
In excellent combination of essential vitamin and minerals. I took it for myself and for my parents.,5
His brand is considered one of the best by American naturopaths and nutritionists. Why - I don’t know and I don’t presume to judge but over 10 years of shopping on this site I noticed that the supplement of this company are really always working with good dosage and formula. In addition he often won various local rating of the American market. In a word vitamin D is vitamin D in Africa as well. Everyone needs it always. Doses of 5000 units or more are recommended to be accompanied by the intake of vitamin K which is present in the formula in 3 forms. That's cool. But here is a large dosage of iodine which I would not just take. His does not mean that iodine is not useful but the body will not assimilate it correctly out of habit. It is necessary to prepare for taking iodine in such dosage at least 2-3 weeks before taking 100-200 units of least-free selenium in the morning at least 500 my of vitamin C in any form and at least 400 my of zinc and magnesium per day. Of all this is in your home then you can take the risk. Although I keep an eye on the minerals in my diet I run the risk of only taking a couple of pills every 2 weeks. Is soon as the pimples begin to crawl out I immediately understand that iodine works it displaces toxic compounds that stick from everywhere in the form of skin problems. And then I give the body time to digest what is happening. In short the complex is great but please do not buy it if you do not follow the intake of other minerals - the thyreoid gland may not stand it. His drug is definitely not for thoughtless use. He careful with him. And so the recommendations are standard take with a fat breakfast since the assimilation of these fat-double elements takes place up to 12 hours these are the internal processes and at least do something but you have to have breakfast before 12 if you want to get the effect and not the expensive m * ch sorry,5
