Dear site visitors so why take vitamin Of with vitamin K It turns out the matter is this Both vitamin are involved in the metabolism of bones and connective tissue. They contribute to the absorption and use of calcium in the early stages of bone formation as well as provide the interaction of calcium and magnesium. Vitamin K-2 in the form of of-7 is necessary for vitamin Of for its better absorption. In the absence of vitamin Of calcium circulating in the body which is absorbed from food can be deposited in the soft tissues of the body and in the arteries which leads to atherosclerosis. Therefore vitamin Of is preferably taken in combination with vitamin Of. These two vitamin work together and calcium obtained from food is deposited in the bones not in the arteries. In addition to its useful properties in the complex work with vitamin D-3 Vitamin K-2 is a new nutrient that supports the cardiovascular system because clinical studies have confirmed that it provides a decrease in arterial stiffness. But not all Of have shown this health benefit. Of in the form of MK7 is a newer substance with a large number of practical applications since it stays in the body longer; its half-life is three days that is in comparison with MK4 or Of the chances of getting its stable level in the blood are much higher. I wish you good health friends.,4
It is believed that 80% of the population of the Northern Hemisphere has a chronic vitamin D deficiency. Deficiency provokes rickets in children and in adults insomnia weakness bad mood decreased immunity could complications are observed twice as often in the presence of a deficiency and osteoporosis. I would think that these are all such special rumors that everyone would take a paid test and buy artificial vitamin D. But There are specific figures that were unexpectedly received inside my family. Given - 4 girls 1. 71 years old lives in the village every day in the fresh air homemade eggs cottage cheese and whole milk. 2. 73 years living in the city walking every day still working. 3. 19 years old goes in for sports studies and is a lot of nervous about the stress at the university. 4. The has been living in the city for 44 years is active mainly in the area of the lawton this is the job and the kitchen sometimes she takes herself out of the house. It's me. All at different times for various reasons were tested this year for the level of 25- of D. Girls who are 71 were given a referral for analysis because there are pronounced pathological changes in the skeleton system and calcium for normal absorption from the intestine and distribution the skeleton system needs a sufficient amount of vitamin D. The one who is 19 - in search of the cause of headache and frequent cold. The one who was 44 surprised by the previous red-there noted her frequent blue and decided to hand over too. The norm is 25- of D from 30 and above. 20 to 30 is considered insufficient. Up to 20 is a deficit. For us girls with 25- of D it turned out like this 1. the one who is 71 in the village - 17 2. the one who is 73 in the city - 9 3. the one who is 19 - 13 4. I - 8. That is in our focus group 100% had a deficit. The one who is less likely to be outside and moves a little is the strongest. 8 for me When a pronounced deficit is established it is no longer replenished with cod liver and homemade milk but with preparations containing high doses of vitamin D. High doses are from 5000 thousand of units per day and above. He are terrified and sold in pharmacies up to 2000 of because high doses of vitamin D used inappropriately can be toxic. Is a result the normal level of vitamin D confirmed by a repeated test increased from 13 to 43 in the girl who is 19. It is too early for the rest to detest. First they ordered this one to quickly fill the deficit Solaray-Vitamin-Of-Of 5000 of here 60 capsules are enough for 2 months usually they recommend up to 6 months and re-analysis. After three months and forms in the analysis I now take this complex for myself and for her 2500 of. With a dose of 5000 and sports at age 19 it took 3 months  often longer . The took vitamin Of 5000  vitamin Of. There is a france - when a deficiency is established and the recommended dose of vitamin Of exceeds 2500 units per day you need to simultaneously take vitamin Of which prevents vascular calcification and helps the distribution of calcium into the skeleton system. His complex is convenient in that Of is already present. Of you take separately Of in a high dosage it is advisable to take Of 100 mug at the same time.When the norm is reached repeated test is done you can take the usual prophylactic daily dose of 400 to 1000 of this is the daily minimum that everyone needs in our latitude. Or 5000 once a week. Therapeutic from 2000 units. The main thing is to consult about the dose and form with your doctor and do a test Met me know if the review is helpful ,5

Consider side effects when taking vitamin. The daily some of vitamin K for adults is 1 mug per g of body weight per day. A typical diet contains 300 to 500 mug of It K per day.

Take 1 capsule in the morning with opera. Added at the same time opera in a capsule with olive oil to improve absorption yet vitamin D is a fat-double vitamin.

Of you have purchased calcium in any form then you must take vitamin Of and Of with it. With Of in principle everything is clear but about Of the controversy does not subside. Any consider it useless and ineffective especially our doctors and pharmacists. Often because they are not interested in anything they do not try therefore they deny.
